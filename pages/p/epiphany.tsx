                        The phonograph in the top-left with tiny media buttons is to automatically play music. I suggested to remove it as users typically never want to hear sounds played without consent.<br />

                        The center column showed a news log, each contained a title and timestamp of when it was created. Notices can be created, modified and deleted by moderators via control panel accessible only to web-admins.

                        No longer did I have to use GET methods to parse URLs. Laravel has a built-in Routing API which allowed me to create prettier links.

                        You can easily establish database connections, create requests without causing exceptions and errors aren't displayed to users.<br />
                        There's also a really neat templating tool called Blade which allowed for page design inheritance, content yielding, components, PHP code shortcuts and so much more.<br />

                        You can apply something called a middleware to certain pages to prevent access. For example, instead of boilerplating code for checking account authentication on certain pages, they go through a middleware. Should the user not be logged-in, they are seamlessly redirected to the home page, or login page before continuing.
